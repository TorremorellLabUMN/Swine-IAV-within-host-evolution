Note: Same as the evolutionary rate calculation, as only H1N1 NS gene amplified for sample 4931 and no SNV identified in this gene segment, the nucleotide diversity of H1N1 NS1 and NS2 were mannually added in the exported files and we didn't calculate and use the H1N1 whole genome nucleotide diversity of sample 4931 for statistically analysis.
