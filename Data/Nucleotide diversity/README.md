Note: Same as the evolutionary rate calculation, as only H1N1 NS gene amplified for sample 4931 and no SNV identified in this gene segment, the nucleotide diversity of H1N1 NS1 and NS2 were mannually added in the exported files and we didn't calculate and use the nucleotide diversity of H1N1 virus in sample 4931 at whole genome level for statistically analysis.
