# False SNV removing

The script is generated to remove the variants that mistakenly recorded in the report which due to the nucleotide differences between the challenge viruses (mismapping between the reads and reference templiate due to the close genetic distance of internal segments between H1N1 and H3N2 challenge viruses).

# Command line

python False_SNV_removing.py Reference_file.csv input_file.vcf output_file.vcf

The reference files are generated by Geneious which display the nucleotide different between two challenge viruses by segment.
The input files are generated by VarScan which listed the information of all the report variants.
